## Developing the bundled providers

Amazon, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Tidal, and Qobuz have reviewable source in `sources/<provider>/` and
offline regression tests in `tests/`. Edit the source, bump its manifest
version, and run:

```sh
node --test tests/*.test.cjs
python3 scripts/build_packages.py
python3 scripts/build_packages.py --check
```

The tests use Node.js 22 or newer and mock provider responses; they do not
contact music services. The Python 3 script creates reproducible `.sflx`
archives and updates their versions and SHA-256 digests in `registry.json`.
Pass provider directory names to rebuild a subset, for example
`python3 scripts/build_packages.py amazon tidal-web`.

Commit source, tests, packages, and registry changes together. Other providers
remain package-only until their source is added to this layout.
